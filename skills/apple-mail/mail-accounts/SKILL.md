# Mail Accounts — Discover All Synced Accounts

List every account synced in Apple Mail with identity, type, and stats.

## Steps

### 1. Get all account UUIDs
```bash
ls ~/Library/Mail/V10/ | grep -v MailData | grep -v "^$"
```

### 2. For each UUID, identify the email address and account type
Query the most frequent recipient address (most reliable identity signal):
```bash
DB="$HOME/Library/Mail/V10/MailData/Envelope Index"

for UUID in $(ls ~/Library/Mail/V10/ | grep -v MailData); do
  # Account type from mailbox URL prefix
  TYPE=$(sqlite3 "$DB" "SELECT url FROM mailboxes WHERE url LIKE '%${UUID}%' LIMIT 1;" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '^[a-z]+')

  # Sender of Sent mail = this account's address (reliable; avoids mailing list CC pollution)
  EMAIL=$(sqlite3 "$DB" "
    SELECT a.address
    FROM messages m
    JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox=mb.ROWID
    JOIN addresses a ON m.sender=a.ROWID
    WHERE mb.url LIKE '%${UUID}%'
      AND (mb.url LIKE '%Sent%' OR mb.url LIKE '%sent%')
      AND a.address LIKE '%@%'
    GROUP BY a.address ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;" 2>/dev/null)

  # Fallback if no Sent mail: most frequent To: recipient in INBOX
  if [ -z "$EMAIL" ]; then
    EMAIL=$(sqlite3 "$DB" "
      SELECT a.address
      FROM messages m
      JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox=mb.ROWID
      JOIN recipients r ON r.message=m.ROWID
      JOIN addresses a ON r.address=a.ROWID
      WHERE mb.url LIKE '%${UUID}%/INBOX%' AND r.type = 0
      GROUP BY a.address ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;" 2>/dev/null)
  fi

  # Total message count
  TOTAL=$(sqlite3 "$DB" "
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages m
    JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox=mb.ROWID
    WHERE mb.url LIKE '%${UUID}%' AND m.deleted=0;" 2>/dev/null)

  # Unread count
  UNREAD=$(sqlite3 "$DB" "
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages m
    JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox=mb.ROWID
    WHERE mb.url LIKE '%${UUID}%' AND m.deleted=0 AND m.read=0;" 2>/dev/null)

  echo "${UUID}|${TYPE}|${EMAIL}|${TOTAL}|${UNREAD}"
done
```

### 3. List mailbox folders for each account
```bash
sqlite3 "$DB" "
  SELECT DISTINCT url FROM mailboxes
  WHERE url LIKE '%UUID_HERE%'
  ORDER BY url;" 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Get per-account message volume over time
```bash
sqlite3 "$DB" "
  SELECT mb.url,
    strftime('%Y-%m', datetime(m.date_received,'unixepoch','localtime')) as month,
    COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM messages m
  JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox=mb.ROWID
  WHERE mb.url LIKE '%UUID_HERE%' AND m.deleted=0
  GROUP BY month ORDER BY month DESC LIMIT 24;" 2>/dev/null
```

## Output Format
Present as a table:

| Account | Type | Total | Unread |
|---|---|---|---|
| user@gmail.com | Gmail/IMAP | 58,996 | 42 |
| user@company.com | Exchange | 68,466 | 7 |

Then list folder structure per account if helpful.
Note accounts that have high unread counts as potentially needing attention.
