# Mail Needs Reply — Unanswered Emails

Looking for: unread emails from humans (not bots) with no follow-up in your Sent.

## Step 1: Get unread emails from non-automated senders
```bash
DB="$HOME/Library/Mail/V10/MailData/Envelope Index"
SINCE=$(($(date +%s) - 604800))  # 7 days default

sqlite3 "$DB" "
SELECT datetime(m.date_received,'unixepoch','localtime') as dt,
       s.subject, a.address as sender, a.comment as name,
       mb.url as mailbox, m.ROWID, m.conversation_id,
       m.date_received
FROM messages m
JOIN subjects  s  ON m.subject = s.ROWID
JOIN addresses a  ON m.sender  = a.ROWID
JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox = mb.ROWID
WHERE m.date_received >= ${SINCE}
  AND m.read = 0
  AND m.deleted = 0
  AND m.automated_conversation = 0
  AND m.unsubscribe_type = 0
  AND mb.url NOT LIKE '%Spam%' AND mb.url NOT LIKE '%Trash%'
  AND mb.url NOT LIKE '%Junk%' AND mb.url NOT LIKE '%Sent%'
ORDER BY m.date_received ASC;" 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 2: Check if a reply exists in the same conversation
For each candidate, check if there's a sent message in the same conversation:
```bash
sqlite3 "$DB" "
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages m
JOIN mailboxes mb ON m.mailbox = mb.ROWID
WHERE m.conversation_id = <CONVERSATION_ID>
  AND (mb.url LIKE '%Sent%' OR mb.url LIKE '%sent%')
  AND m.date_received > <ORIGINAL_DATE>;" 2>/dev/null
```
If count > 0, you already replied — skip this email.

## Step 3: Age-based prioritization
Group by urgency:
- **Overdue (>3 days unread):** oldest first — likely forgotten
- **Aging (1-3 days):** need attention soon
- **Recent (<1 day):** just came in

## Step 4: Read the most overdue ones
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_mail-shared/parser.py <ROWID1> <ROWID2>
```

## Output Format
**Emails Waiting for Your Reply**

For each:
- **Age** | **From** | **Subject** | [brief context from body if readable]

Group: Overdue → Aging → Recent
Total count up front. Note longest-waiting email specifically.
Offer to draft a reply to any of them.
